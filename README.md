Building a Website Sharing EDGAR Web Logs
We use the flask framework to build a website that displays the analysis
of user behavior. The website has the following features:
(1) a link to a donation page that is optimized via A/B testing,
(2) a page within the website that displays the data in html and JSON format,
(3) a page within the website that displays analysis and plots of the data,
(4) a homepage page.
